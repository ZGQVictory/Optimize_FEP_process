# Optimize_FEP_process
The purpose of this repository is to minimize the cost of time in the standard FEP process.

## Statement 
As a junior in my group, it's quite interesting for me to generate a optimizable process to update all the traditional steps.


For a trivial process of the common FEP step, we'd like to follow the steps as followed:

  1. MD to equilibrium
  2. split
  3. mutation
  4. combine
  5. solvate
  6. ionized
  7. set the A & B state
  8.
